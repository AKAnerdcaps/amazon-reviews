Broke within 30 days,1.0 out of 5 stars,The controller broke within 30 days of use. The seller won’t contact me. They just used a robot to tell me too bad.
Super fun!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product to use, love the design and how fast the games run on it. 100x better than my old ps4"
For my son,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A gift for my son for house sitting, he was thrilled."
All good,5.0 out of 5 stars,It came perfectly packaged. The console works perfectly and was delivered in time.
Works great!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving it so far! Had to get an extra hard drive but was easy to install! Well worth the money and I believe I bought 3.of the PS5 disk versions but only the one here and wish I had done that with all 3 instead of just this one but happy with it!
Excelente,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfecto
10 Stars - one of the best things I own,5.0 out of 5 stars,A dazzling machine with stunning games. Yeah I drooled over Atari games - how far we have come.
Great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, came as expected love to play games"
Terrible Repair/Replacement Process,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After 2 years and a few months of having the PS5, I ran into an issue where the entire console shut down after about 30 minutes to an hour of having it on. This happened even after a long cooldown period, and then waiting a few days and trying an entirely new power cord. I did not damage the console in any way prior to this happening. I contacted Sony to get a repair/replacement and of course it's just out of warranty, so I paid the out-of-warranty fee of $250 since gaming is my main hobby and I wanted to get it fixed as soon as possible. I went through the return process online and got through the payment part then received no additional information. I called support right after to address this and was told 2 times that I had to wait for a box, and that it could take 7-10 business days. 10 business days later, I still had no update and no box. I called again and was told that no box was ever shipped to me, but it was going to be shipped out now. 8 business days later from call #2, and I have received no update and no box. I tried to email a support inbox twice about the issue, but I received no word back as I'm not sure the email address is even functional. They make it extremely difficult to get in touch with the company in any capacity and have pre-determined scripts it appears for any complaints, or try to pass it off to automated responses. It has now been almost an entire month with no update, no meaningful communication, and no box. This process is absolutely insane to me having already spent $250 upfront. There's no reason I should be expecting this from a multibillion dollar company. Atrocious return process so far, and potentially the worst customer service experience I have ever had."
PS 5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing PS 5 best playstation ever fast and graphics amazing
It's a PS5 what else is there to say.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The product is really big, but it works great. I have the disc version to look at Black Panther in 4K. It looks great. The games run smoothly, and great as well. The controller fells comfortable. The downsize is I had to purchase and adapter for my Astro A50 headset. The is changes the 120GHz to 60gHz. Other than that I'm happy with this."
Perfecto,5.0 out of 5 stars,No llego a tiempo pero llego Perfecto
Ps5 looks essentially brand new,5.0 out of 5 stars,"did come with a black controller but i dont mind it at all, id recommend them"
Looks cool but isn't great,1.0 out of 5 stars,This console looks very cool but it sounds very loud and is nowhere near as good as my computer. I gave it to my little sister.
Fun to play,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fun to play
Of course the best ps5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s PlayStation 5, the best. I prefer the disc version, but digital is same thing, just have to download games & can’t sell games later when your done with the disc. They don’t come with much gb storage, so if you play more then 5-6 games at a time, you will have to buy extra storage space. Ps plus is 60$ a month, but you can find cheaper. You must have ps plus to play most games online with other players."
Can trust this seller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got my PS5 a little bit late but that was due to UPS. Unboxed and set up runs perfectly with no problems. If you are looking for a PS5 get it from this seller.
disk drive not working,1.0 out of 5 stars,"disk drive not working.I inserted different game discs, but still did not work"
PS5!,5.0 out of 5 stars,What can I say that you don't already know? PS5 is the best console currently on the market. Massive improvement over the PS4 in terms of software and backward compatibility.

Junk!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my nephews birthday, the right trigger didn’t work and after downloading all the updates (almost 3 hrs) all the apps kept crashing or freezing up. Ruined my nephews birthday. all his friends came over to play because they knew he was getting the ps5, Buy from someone else. So his day wouldn’t be ruined I went out and bought a brand new one from Best Buy for extra $100. All Amazon did was deliver disappointment and frustration."
I’ll recommend it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good one.

Hard to mess up a PS5,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a PS5 soooo….what’s there to be mad about?!
The review is about both the seller and the product.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Everything shipped and arrived in the original box with a gash down the side of the box. Nothing wrong with the unit that I could see. No scratches or marks. The cables look like they might have been hooked up once. Just to see if it works. Everything was repackaged back exactly like new, even the cables were wound up in a way that looked like it was never used. Maybe it wasnt. In any case, everything was like new. Turned on and worked like it should. Data transfers are a pain unless you use the cloud storage from playstation plus. Then its easy. Rather than download all your ps4 games all over again, its better to transfer to an external usb drive then transfer from the drive to the console storage or keep it on your usb. Small games dont need to be on the ps5's SSD. Games like fallout 76 however, even though its a ps4 game, when loaded onto the SSD, makes load times dependent on your internet speed and not your systems resources. Fallout 76 is always loading. Everytime you teleport or exit an area. Not on PS5. Not all games will show this kind of increase in speed as some games have loading screens built in on a timer. Only ps4 games though and only a small handful of them cant use the SSD to its full potential but it doesnt matter. The cpu and graphics power reduces load time on its own as well. The storage space of the unit though, is small. Its not even 1 terrabyte so keep that in mind. You will have to run a lot of games off of a usb external drive. What you do , is keep about 150 gigs free on the storage unit at all times. When you get a new game that is load intensive like cyperpunk or red dead or fallout, install it onto the storage unit but when you are done with it , transfer the data back to the usb external. Only use your SSD to store games from PS5 or PS4 games that spend half its time on loading screens like fallout 76. Other than that, the new cpus and graphics power will reduce load times enough for the older games that you wont care about the fact its not on the SSD. Also, the communication speed across the usb cable is drastically increased. USB 3.0 makes a huge difference in load times off the external drive too. So this unit is cool so far. There are some changes made to the OS that most of you PS4 users wont like. No way to turn off sound to the OS. Closing games and apps requires getting used too and it takes more time and effort than it did before. You have to memorize new menu wordings and settings have been moved around. WHICH EVERYONE FINDS ANNOYING AND POINTLESS. If you like playing with headphones you will notice that the output for the volume on the HDMI is lower than you remember. Volume you cant ADJUST. So if you run an HDMI into a TV then use the TVs output into a headphone jack, you will notice the volume is reduced a ton. This forces you to use the headphone jack in the controller, which is beautifully loud and clear and has updated sound drivers that make it noticeably higher quality. But it feels awkward to hold a controller with a cord coming out the bottom. It does give you the ability to walk around freely with no cords to hold you back but id rather my HDMI output be boosted more than it is. When I go to race GT7 online , I have computer audio and PS5 audio ran through a splitter to control my playlist while racing and listening to the engine sounds. With this reduced sound volume through HDMI, i doubt ill be able to even hear my engine sounds while music is playing and there is no way to boost the volume. Cant use the controller port for this solution. The PS5 system software needs a volume control option for the entire OS. Scroll over monopoly plus on the home page and it plays music. I hate that. No way to turn it off. Scrolling through your games shuffles random annoying theme music for every game. No way to turn it off. You need to set your own DNS servers? TOO BAD. Cant really do that anymore without building a completely new connection from the ground up. You cant choose to auto the IP and then manual the DNS. Nope. Everything has to be entered manually. No skipping or auto this and manual that. ALL manual. Or all auto. Thats DUMB and POINTLESS. PS4 game you paid 60$ for? Like GT7? Well if you want the PS5 version they want another 10 dollars. Other games though give you FREE ps5 upgraded versions. Only GT7 and Ghost of Tsushima and Final Fantasy 7 remake (FF7 remake forces you to upgrade to plus EXTRA , its not even about money they want a subscription) force you to pay more. At least, thats all I have in my library that forced me to pay more. So look. This system is not really for dirt poor people. Even if you have a slow internet connection, it will mess with your ability to enjoy this system. Im still waiting on my GT7 ps5 version to finish downloading. ETA? 40 hrs. Thats just one game. If I had my own high speed internet plan though, I could reduce that to about 2 hrs. So be prepared for that. You probably wont be able to play the system the day you buy it. It will take time to transfer your data or download it all over again. The OS sucks and has less features to it than the PS4 did and ive yet to play an actual ps5 game and its been two days. However, just the way it handled fallout 76 made me feel it was worth it. Once you get through all the installation and downloading and updating headaches, and you get used to the more aggravating OS with no themes and backrounds to choose from, and you can solve your audio issues with your custom audio system, I think youll find the system worthy. Its MASSIVE but as quiet as a old 1987 NES. Not a lot of heat either but Id still run a fan on her just because. Im sure the graphics on a ps5 game are beautiful but I wont update my review to tell you about that. You already know the graphics will be great."

King of Gaming,5.0 out of 5 stars,Self explanatory
Damaged item with food on it,1.0 out of 5 stars,Item was damaged and had food sauce on it
PS5 without a doubt is the best,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, PS5 of course is the newest and best gaming console. Great 4k, apps, unique features, and love the controller. The only thing that made me slightly hesitant, is when ordering PS5 from amazon the box came beat up a bit and the corners smashed in. The console is fine, but risky knowing a device this expensive was thrown around."
BEST EVER!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best gaming console ever
Addicting!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very fast console with high graphics and fun. The console is too addicting to play!
Best console,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best console with the best games. No questions about it
My PS5 is the best!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The graphics are absolutely stunning and the gameplay is incredibly smooth. The console is also very fast, with loading times that are significantly shorter than my previous console. The Dual-Sense controller is a major upgrade, with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers that add a new level of immersion to my gaming experience. The user interface is easy to navigate and the console is very sleek and stylish. The customer service team was also very helpful with any questions I had about the product. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend the PlayStation 5 to any gamer in need of a top-quality console."
Got the invite,5.0 out of 5 stars,Waited forever for one to be available at a reasonable price so love it
Defective upon arrival,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was a christmas gift for my son and i was happy to receive the invite. I had it sent to a amazon hub and thankfully I did because it came in its original packaging, no outside box, protection or anything. I was not very happy with that for something that was so expensive, I mean could you imagine if this was left on my porch. Anyways Christmas day he opens the ps5 everything looks ok until he hooks it up to the tv it appears normal until it does its update and after that the screen never comes back it just stays black and all they offer is a return. My son didn't even get to play it. Smh"
❤️,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it.
PS5 BABY!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got a PS5 about a year ago but have noticed how easy it is to get one now. All you really need to is literally request one, and within a week or so, you will get an invitation. It seems supply is catching up to demand now."
Broken Controller,2.0 out of 5 stars,"after 3 months of ownership, and honestly light used. like twice for the past 3 months... the controller is defective. now that the holidays are here I have some free time and said to myself finally I get to play some ps5.. YEA RIGHT! the controller is broken it moves without touching it.. found out they called it drifting. sony now wants me to send them back the controller .. but guess who's paying shipping cost.. ??!! ME."
Finally =),5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had to get this one delivered to a holding location, it's too precious. I signed up for invites, a few weeks later received an invite from Amazon, ordered it and it was delivered within a few days. Works perfectly and so smooth even after transferring data from PS4. I'm super hyped I'll actually be able to play the games I've been waiting on like Hogwarts Legacy and FFXVI at release."
Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth every dollar
Nice,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best console I ever had
Great delivery!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was very happy with the way they shipped the product, and the fact that it came earlier than expected. It works fantastic and was a wonderful upgrade"
A lot of hype,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Pro4 that has been great for many years, with an updated multi-TB SSD it is as good if not better than the PS5. Now I have a friend with a standard PS4 and for him it was night and day better.Not a lot of games out on PS5 yet and I am considering selling it off and waiting to re-buy in the future. Do NOT Overpay for the PS5. Amazon is best place if you do choose to go forward, because they are not robbing you with a mark up. However if you have a Pro4, I would wait for the inevitable PS5Pro down the road."
5 estrellas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Solamente tiene 600GB de almacenamiento...
Worth the wait,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth the wait , bought from Amazon for retail. Amazon has such a better process for buying a ps5 compared to the PS store . If you ask for an invitation to buy a ps5 from amazon and get an invitation in your email , you for sure 100% can order one . It’s not a free for all like the other method for buying it from the manufacturer for retail . I love that Amazon made the process easy and straightforward. It’s a great system , our ps4 couldn’t handle some games and would sound like it was getting ready to take off flying . The ps5 is so smooth and quiet . Doesn’t overheat . It’s been fun for sure . Worth the wait . Paying Retail is awesome. I like buying directly from amazon as the seller. It did get dropped off with my bottled water boxes and just left . If you order one be aware it will just be left on your doorstep like it’s a $12 case of water . Not signing for it surprised me a lot ."

Graphics are awesome and built in features and UI are great aswell. It's truely a 1 stop media center. Well worth the $500 price tag! Sony >> Microsoft
Perfect,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect
Great but not what they hype it to be,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great system. Best I've tried. But don't expect next gen new games. I've regretted the buy cause 80% of games are remakes for next gen. Not many ps only new guns. Sony was great ps4 but I'm still only seeing ps3/ps4 remakes now. Such a waste. Wouldn't of bought if knew all games ps4 till 2024 and pa5 games stay last gen pretty much cause releasing ps4 versions. If don't belive me look at xbox s. Same
"Good PS5, but it is so hard to buy",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Coming from having a PS4 my entire life, upgrading to the PS5 is great. The graphics, selections of games, and the processing is outstanding, along with many other features and perks. The only reason that I'm rating this a 3 star is how hard it is to come by. I've been searching for it since the first day that it got released, and was only able to cop after a worthwhile search.Pros -1. Built quality is good2. Comes with controllers3. Better games, sounds, graphics, than the PS4Cons -1. Extremely hard to come by."
Real,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought it for the Hubby and he Loves it!!
PS5 > Xbox,5.0 out of 5 stars,My gf doesnt love that I love this thing so much....But man its just so fun to play. the graphics are insane and the design on the ps5 is sweet. hope everyone has been able to get their hands on one

As expected,5.0 out of 5 stars,Signed up for invite. Got invite. PS5 delivered. Dream fulfilled. Worth the wait to just pay retail. The system itself is amazing. Everything I hoped for.
SCAM ALERT,1.0 out of 5 stars,I cannot be truthful about my experience with trying to buy this product. All efforts to be truthful have been either denied or deleted.
I love it! A masterpiece!,5.0 out of 5 stars,The games look breakthtaking on my 4K OLED TV. I got 3 extra DualSense controllers for couch co op. These feel so good! I waited forever and Im so happy that the PS5 is so much fun!
Excelente precio,5.0 out of 5 stars,Me parece muy justa la propuesta de Amazon
The model 1102A increases temperature.,3.0 out of 5 stars,I cancelled my order. I found the temperature increases from original 53 Celsius to 63 Celsius. So I am rather waiting for the next model 1200 that backs to 53 Celsius.
Worth the wait!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After looking for almost a year, and waiting months for an invite to purchase, I was able to order the PS5 disc edition and I cannot be more pleased. I picked up Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart to start my library, and both are more than impressive. The system is easy to set up, and the resolution is incredible, even on a non-4K television. I am using a 1080p LG oled and the picture and frame rate is magnificent. When I upgrade TV's later on, I can only imagine the difference."
Two years worth the wait,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been waiting two years to get this. Signed up for amazons invitation system and got it four months later. Glad I did
Defective Product,1.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased this as a gift for my family and because it's outside the return window I can't get any support. I followed all steps the Ps5 turns on but will not show anything on my TV. I have all cables run correctly and still nothing. Waste of a lot of money. I have been a PS user since PS1 and my loyalty is done after this. I have a $600 paperweight
Worth it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"100% worth the purchase. Took me almost a year to procure but I’m so happy I didn’t settle. I don’t know how much faster than the PS4, but it blows it out of the water. It’s more than a “glorified streaming device”"
Very Playstationey!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing plays PS5 games like a MONSTER! It's the real deal! The only downside is the controller battery charge duration is equivalent to a 3oz canteen on a July Death Valley survival hike.Bonus: it does play most (not all) PS4 games, so you don't need to trash all your antique retro games like Anthem."
My brand new ps5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved the console, loved the shipping and handling. Amazon is the best for buying and shipping items and this is where I shop at for now on."
4k Q.L.E.D. & 4 terrabit SSD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"That's $1,400 w/ playstation plus and a couple games, maybe a spare controller.... i can't commit, sorry. I KNOW THATS THE CUTTING EDGE.I am more of a last gen, person (Nintendo Switch O.L.E.D. totals $800). On my 10 year old t.v.Just got tired of PS3 playing Skyrim, Batman, GTA5, Assassin's Creed, Fallout 3.....A COMPUTER IS A BETTER OPTION IN 2022, IF YOU CAN PUT $2K TOGETHER, dual screens might get very pricey. I believe, I need lots more money to setup a proper entertainment center.PS5 is like having a computer on your 4K T.V...i want a dual monitor computer as the entertainment center. If I have a couple months of rent to blow....."
ITS AMAZING,5.0 out of 5 stars,i purchased it off amazon during 2020 and it’s been amazing ever since I have no regrets and if you can get your hands on one do it!!!!
