# Amazon Review Scraper

This Python script allows you to scrape product reviews from Amazon for a specified ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number). It utilizes the `requests-html` library for web scraping and stores the scraped data in a Pandas DataFrame before saving it to a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your local machine.
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
- A valid Amazon ASIN for the product whose reviews you want to scrape.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages by running:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Edit the `asin` variable in the script to specify the ASIN of the product you want to scrape:

   ```python
   asin = 'B09DFCB66S'  # Replace with your desired ASIN
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python amazon_review_scraper.py
   ```

The script will start scraping reviews and saving them to a CSV file (`data/{asin}-reviews.csv`).

## Customization

- You can customize the number of pages to scrape by adjusting the range in the for loop:

   ```python
   for page in range(1, 20):  # Change '20' to the desired number of pages
   ```

- To modify the user-agent or other scraping parameters, you can edit the `headers` and `base_url` variables in the script.

## Output

The scraped reviews will be saved in a CSV file in the `data` directory with a filename in the format `{asin}-reviews.csv`.

## Logging

The script logs information and errors to a log file named `amazon_review_scraper.log` for reference.
